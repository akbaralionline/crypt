# crypt
AES like cryptography 
It is very simple to use for the personal use. The source code can be compiled using the gcc compiler and use the help for execution.
Crypt: A command line encryption decryption tool similar to AES encryption declaration.
Crypt uses Hexacode key for the encryption and decryption. User need to generate the key and the recommended minimum size is 8 digit eg 2A5B6C7D. As long as the size of the key increases the data will be more secured.
Syntax:   crypt -option hexakey source target
Option:
        -e for encryption and -d for decryption
			   hexakey is the userdefined encryption and decryption key
			  source is the source file
			  target is the target file
Crypt uses Hexacode key for the encryption and decryption. User need to generate the key and the recommended minimum size is 8 digit eg 2A5B6C7D. As long as the size of the key increases the data will be more secured. The hexa decimal values ranges from 0-9 and A-F. Crypt will not accept any other character apart from hexadecimal values.
